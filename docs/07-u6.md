## Unit 6: Facilitating Cooperative Learning Activities{-}

Transformational learning at TWU is a profoundly social endeavour, much like many engaging learning environments. As a social species, we learn a great deal from each other in both formal and informal contexts. Our very earliest learning experiences are profoundly social and intimate interactions between mother and child, and the social aspect of learning never ceases to be important. During this unit, we will examine a short history of social theories of learning from John Dewey and Lev Vygotsky, then we will spend some time experimenting with and learning about Liberating Structures.

## Learning Outcomes{-}
When you have completed this unit you should be able to:
* Design cooperative activities to maximize student-student and student-content interactions.
* Apply knowledge of liberating structures to cooperative learning activities.

## Topic 1: Social Theories of Learning

The idea that learning is a social process can be traced way back in time, but formal descriptions of social constructivism, as it has been called, are often traced to John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and Lev Vygotsky.

Modern conceptions of the learning process are based on the idea that knowledge is *constructed* by learners as they encounter new information, compare it to old models that they may have, and develop new understandings of how the world works. It is not the case that new knowledge is simply copied intact from one mind to another, rather new information is integrated into old, bringing about a hybrid of the two. This is essentially what we understand as a *constructivist* model of learning.

#### Zone of Proximal Development{-}

Social constructivism is the idea that this process of integrating new understandings with old understandings is best understood as a *social* process. Vygotsky's model of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) is helpful in understanding how this is conceptualized. The ZPD is the 'sweet spot' in education where a student is optimally challenged to learn. If the task is too easy for the student, and they have already mastered it, then learning activities will not result in learning. Conversely, if a task is so difficult that the student cannot complete it, even with assistance, learning activities will not result in learning. In the middle are tasks that a student is able to complete, but only with the assistance of a more capable peer or expert. This is the Zone of Proximal Development.

##### Teaching in the ZPD{-}

Teaching with the ZPD in mind assumes that you, as the teacher, know what knowledge and skills your students are starting with. It is likely that the competencies that your students display fall along a bell curve. While most students will be in a similar ZPD, there will be outliers at both ends of the curve. One strategy can be to pair students whose skills and knowledge are below the curve with those above the curve. In doing this, students who are above the curve, who may not be challenged with the content or skill, have to engage in greater levels of cognitive complexity in order to concisely explain to their peer and help them to meet the objective. In my M.Ed. thesis (summarized in Madland & Richards, 2016) exploring a cooperative peer review activity, I asked participants how they thought cooperative learning activities supported learning. Their responses indicated that the two most important factors were *social cohesion* and *developmentally appropriate challenges*, indicating that they recognized the importance of the ZPD in learning.

### Cooperative Learning{-}

Cooperative learning is a set of teaching and learning strategies that are focussed on encouraging educative social interactions between learners. It is important to not conflate *cooperative learning* with *group projects* as you might remember them from your previous experiences in higher ed. Group projects are often assigned because faculty seem to have a sense that *working together* is a good thing for students, along with a vague sense that modern jobs all require teamwork. Too often, they amount to repurposing an individual assignment (maybe a research paper) into the same task, but with multiple people handing in one item instead of 3-4. When these tasks are not well structured, the process becomes problematic.

![](group-projects.jpg)

We have all likely experienced less-than-ideal group projects where one or two people do most of the work, one member is seemingly absent altogether, and another's work is of poor quality. This is not the kind of learning activity that inspires highly engaged learners.

Contrary to that model, cooperative learning is structured in a way that maximizes effort from all students and, ideally, leads to all group members attaining high-level learning outcomes. In order to ensure this, there are 5 characteristics of learning groups that must be present for cooperative learning to occur: "positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interactions, appropriate use of social skills, and group processing" (Johnson & Johnson, 2009, p. 366).


##### Positive Interdependence{-}

Positive interdependence, according to Johnson and Johnson is the idea that individuals in a learning environment are dependent upon each other for success. In other words, I cannot succeed unless you succeed and you cannot succeed unless I succeed. So, collectively, we are interdependent. Positive interdependence is the key that distinguishes cooperative learning from competitive learning, where students are graded on a curve and only the top 2-3% of students can earn 'A' grades.

##### Individual and Group Accountability{-}

In cooperative learning environments, each individual in the group is held accountable for their contributions to the final product, and feedback is provided to both the individual and the group. This helps to ensure that students who need more assistance are identified and can be supported as needed, and it also prevents the 'social loafing' that is common in typical 'group projects'.

##### Promotive Interaction{-}

Promotive interaction is the logistics of working and learning together as a cooperative group. The essence is that group members each need to work to promote the learning of each other member of the group. Since each person will be held accountable for their work *and* the entire group will only succeed if each member succeeds, there is a natural social pressure on more experienced members of the group to assist those with less experience or knowledge.

##### Interpersonal Skills{-}

Not only do members of the group need to learn the *content* of the lesson or project, but they must also learn the *process* of working well as a cooperative group. Sometimes, these processes need to be taught directly, other times (like in graduate studies) it is reasonable to presume that group members will already possess and be willing to utilize effective social skills.

##### Group Processing{-}

Finally, the group must be able to monitor their process with the goal of improving their work process and product. This metacognitive task is crucial to the long-term improvement and progress towards learning goals.

## Topic 3: Practical Facilitation Strategies

The facilitation of courses in the TWU FAR Centre model is unique, as you know. From the perspective of a traditional, campus-based faculty member in Langley, a FAR Centre course is an *online* course. The faculty member has worked with an instructional designer to create a course which integrates everything required to create an online community of inquiry with allowances for all three presences: social, cognitive, and teaching presence. The courses are deployed through online technology and materials are accessed digitally in remote locations. Furthermore, students submit their work to the faculty member who then assesses their work and provides both formative and summative feedback as appropriate.

From the perspective of the remote student, however, the course is much more like a typical F2F course where they are meeting with a group of their fellow students in a central location and are guided through the learning materials by a more experienced 'other'.

The reason for this is that international students often  experience difficulties completing online courses from Western universities, so TWU is providing a F2F Academic Facilitator to assist remote students through the courses. You, as the Academic Facilitation Specialist, are a critical component of this model. Your skills in coaching students through courses and activities where you may not be a subject matter expert are going to be extremely important.

As such, you will need to start thinking about *how* to coach your students through some of the challenges of engaging in learning activities without the immediate F2F presence of a faculty member. In the activity below, you will read about a number of strategies that will help you facilitate TWU courses.  

`Also, perhaps we can add 1-2 more resources (videos, weblinks) that have practical facilitation strategies?`

### Learning Activity 5.1: Read & Discuss

Read Chapter 3 of

!!! Vaughan, N. D., Garrison, D. R., & Cleveland-Innes, M. (2013). *Teaching in blended learning environments: creating and sustaining communities of inquiry*. Retrieved from [http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120229](http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120229)

Click the link to the Free PDF version of the book and either download the entire book, or just chapter 3 for now. You do not need to purchase a printed copy, although you are welcome to do so if you prefer to use printed books.

:fa-podcast:Listen to the following podcast episode from Teaching in Higher Ed:

<a class="embedly-card" href="https://teachinginhighered.com/podcast/my-flipped-classroom/#">My Flipped Classroom - Teaching in Higher Ed</a><script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>



Keeping in mind that the book is written to address *blended learning* environments, and a FAR Centre isn't quite the same as a blended environment for the students, create a post on your blog to write about how this chapter and podcast would inform your work in a FAR centre. Please include something about how you can connect the ideas in the chapter to your past experience, either as a teacher, coach, student, or interested observer of one of those contexts.



Tag your post with `LDRS663` and `5.1`.

## Topic 4: Liberating Structures

It can often be challenging to devise new ways of interacting in F2F environments, but there are many resources available to you both online and in print. One of those resources is a book and website called *Liberating Structures* which describes a set of 33 structured activities that you can use in your class to generate conversation without resorting to the same old tired 'brainstorm'.

:fa-vimeo:Watch the video below for a quick introduction to Liberating Structures.

<a class="embedly-card" href="https://player.vimeo.com/video/58955014">Liberating Structures: Simple, Subtle, Powerful</a><script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>

` Could we add a learning activity here where they go to LS webpage and perhaps in a post describe an LS activity they would like to try out in a far centre?  

Perhaps another learning activity could be to take them through 2 LSs.  E.g. What, So What, Now What? W³ - we can pose questions for students to answer individually (What have you learned so far in this course that has impacted you?), and/or 9 whys (Why do you want to teach overseas?)`

For this activity, you are going to jump into experiencing, at least partially, one of the liberating structures, called W3.
