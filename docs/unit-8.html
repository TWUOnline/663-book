Unit 6: Negotiation, Power and Influence
========</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="overview-5" class="section level2 unnumbered">
<h2>Overview<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#overview-5"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In Unit 6, we will cover types of power, power dynamics, social influence,
empowerment and group decision making. We will look at the definition of power
and how it relates to social influences and learn about the different types of
power and different influencing tactics that can be used to maintain, balance or
diffuse power differentials. We will see how power dynamics can influence and
affect a team and we will see the impact of interdependence on perceived roles
and contributions to group decision-making. Covering the benefits of
empowerment, degrees of empowerment programs and different approaches to promote
successful empowerment, we will also look at ways to encourage and apply
assertiveness. Focus will be placed on the value of group decision making,
advantage and disadvantage and when group decisions are superior to individual
ones. We will see different approaches to group decision-making such as
consultative, consensus and democratic approaches and the impact of emotions,
disagreements and negative pressures on making a group decision and how
different techniques can help with these conflicts.</p>
<p>It should be noted that misuse of power is one of the most damaging forces on a
team. When organizational leaders use their power to influence team members,
when team leaders use their power to bully or override team members and when
higher-ranking members of teams use their power to consolidate influence on a
team, trust across members is significantly impaired. More than this, the
members of the team (especially young members) learn through their experiences
how teams operate for the benefit of the organization. Emerging leaders take
their experiences on teams to either become more effective at building and
maintaining team trust in the future, or they will learn to use power, group
cohesion, blocks and silos, as ways to manipulate teams, they become
increasingly ineffective at leading teams toward organizational purposes.
Leaders have to constantly be vigilant for how their actions, words and
relationships impact others who are looking up to them for guidance on how the
organization should operate. Politicization and bureaucracy does not just happen
by accident any more than family dysfunction is a stroke of bad luck. The seeds
of organizational dysfunction and mistrust are won with every word, every team
engagement and every breach of trust that is made. The challenge is the impact
of our words and deeds rolls downhill. Dysfunction at the lowest levels in an
organization have an impact on a few people. Dysfunction at the top impacts
everyone beneath the leader. Dysfunction and power politics in the middle
affects large swaths of the organization and creates silos.</p>
<p>Teams communicate the values, intent and principles of the organization. Manage
them well and the organization is healthier, more functional, and more competent
to meet people’s needs and make their lives better. Manage them poorly and the
organization is weaker, more dysfunctional and less capable to meet people’s
needs and make their lives better.</p>

<p>In this week’s conference meeting, your professor will provide a 40 minute talk
on the role power influence and negotiation strategies have on team and
organizational decision-making. Following the presentation by the professor will
be a 20 minute interactive dialogue about healthy and unhealthy team leadership
and experiences with poor team leaders.</p>
<p>This 1 hour online session will be recorded for future reference.</p>
<p>In order to prepare for the meeting, you are invited to view the following
slides. Your instructor will go through this presentation

</h3>
<p>Leading teams and managing processes to effectively include every team member in
decision-making and the team’s ‘Story’ is much harder than it seems on the
surface. Leaders are often distracted by the pressures they face from above them
within the organization, the challenges they face across from them with other
leaders at the same level as they are, and management challenges dealing with
those within their own organizational units. Vertical and horizontal pressure
constantly bombard the leader to the point where they often forget that there
are real people within their teams that are trying to make their own way through
the labyrinth of the organization.</p>
<p>The more leaders forget about the real needs of people within their teams, the
more disconnected they can become and the more likely they are to dismiss the
voices of those within their teams that need to be heard.</p>
<p><strong>This exercise is called, “Every Voice Matters”</strong>.</p>
<p>Throughout the internet there are hundreds (possibly thousands) of companies who
are trying to help organizations with team building and communication. Most of
these companies are localized and perform functions, team building activities,
communication and collaboration tools to help organizations use and harness the
power of teams more effectively.</p>
<p>For this week, you are going to search the internet to find teambuilding models,
strategies, exercises and activities that can help the leader do one thing with
their team–Make sure that Every Voice is Heard.</p>
<p>Once you locate the resource on the internet that you believe is a good example
of a strategy that ensures all voices are part of the team conversation, you are
going to review the resource, exercise, game or strategy and write a review of
the exercise and upload for the entire class to review. Much like the research
article review, you are going to play a role in developing resources for the
students of this class and future classes to use as they strive to become more
effective team leaders.</p>
<p>Please see the Assessments section of this unit as it has the requirements for
you to complete for the review.</p>

</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>(Due at the conclusion of week 7)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>What is Conflict Management?</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Conflict management starts with an assumption that conflict is both normal and
healthy in all relationships. Conflict emerges when people have competing
interests, values, and roles or when people differ in their history, age,
gender, experience, ethnicity, etc. People experience conflict every day of
their lives. Conflict is more likely to occur as an internal process than a
process that occurs between people.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>In Psychology, we use terms like cognitive conflict, cognitive disequilibrium,
or cognitive dissonance to describe the internal experience people have when
their internal cognitive representations of the world come into conflict with
their immediate experiences. In fact, all models of growth and personal
development have conflict or tension at the centre of the internal pressure for
people to change, adapt and grow. A concept of Positive Emotive Tension Theory
(PETT) posits that people are strongest when they are in relationships or life
situations that exert tension or pressure on them. The tension that is created
between people is a positive force that enables balance and perspective to
impact people’s decision-making. Most people try to resolve the cognitive
dissonance that is created between internal representations of the world and
external realities of life. The concept of conflict management is that we don’t
have to always resolve conflict. We can live in a world where cognitive
representations are held in a balanced tension for long periods of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Conflict is Good.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Interpersonal conflict management starts with an assumption that conflict is a
good and healthy aspect of relationships. Conflict helps us share our
perspectives, to learn about others and their diverse ways of seeing the world,
to challenge our worldview and to refine our thinking to improve our
decision-making processes. The starting point to become healthy in our approach
to conflict management is to accept that conflict is good and can help us to
learn, improve, and thrive in relationships.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Conflict Management Takes Time.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Although most people would naturally desire to avoid conflict or pretend it
doesn’t exist, conflict identifies a flaw in thinking, flaw in values, flaw in
communication, or a flaw in process. In order to understand the nature of the
flaw, we need to take the time to understand all perspectives, to allow each
voice to be heard, to provide a venue for open and frank discussion, and to
communicate each person’s value to the organization.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Conflict Management Requires Consistent and Stable Structures.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Because people naturally do not trust those who disagree with them, most will
assume negative intentions, vested interests, ulterior motives, or destructive
intent when they come into conflict with others. Because these negative
reactions cloud people’s judgements about ‘the other,’ a good conflict
management process must be structurally clear and consistent. Usually, this type
of management system is defined in organizational policy in order to ensure
people know where to take matters when there is conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Conflict Management Requires Independent Processes.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Again, As with structure, the processes involved in good conflict management
revolve around perceptions of unfairness, power inequality, gender, race and
sexual orientation inequalities (that are all protected by the human rights code
and charter), etc. As a result, there must be clear processes that are
independent of these forces. My experience is that most organizations and people
within them are not inherently biased, but when it comes to conflict, perception
becomes reality. In designing your conflict management model, you must be clear
to develop processes that cannot be influenced unduly by role or title within an
organization. It should be noted from my personal experience that Christian
organizations are often the poorest at developing good processes for conflict
management. Christian organizations start with an understanding that people love
each other, have grace, should put everyone else first, etc. These assumptions
often stem from the ‘masks’ we put on to fit in to the Christian community.
Christians are just as prone to bias, jealousy, hate, competition, feelings of
inadequacy and unfairness, etc as other people. Christian organizations are
generally in more need of good conflict management processes than other
organizations are.</td>

be able to contain their emotions and hold in their thoughts when it comes
to conflict. Often the emotion has been pent up for so long that when it is
time to speak, words are not organized well and thinking is not clear.
anger, rage, hostility, fear, crying all may emerge when discussing
conflicts. The person who is managing the conflict process must not take
things personally as they may initially bear the brunt of the pent up
emotional response.</td>
