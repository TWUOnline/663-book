<tr class="even">
<td>### Overview</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>An enduring principle of educational practice is learners learn in different ways and at different rates. Effective educators recognize the uniqueness of each individual learner. They understand each learner arrives at a new learning situation with different lived experiences, existing knowledge, cognitive processing strengths and weaknesses, learning preferences, values, and goals. At the same time, effective educators also recognize some aspects of the learning process are common to most, if not all, learners. For instance, most educators believe learning is an ongoing, reflective process. We tend to broadly believe human are constantly taking in new information, integrating it into what we already know, and developing ideas based on this merging of past and present. In the midst of educator’s diverse and sometimes contradictory ideas about learning, there seems to be a great deal of mystery, and countless myths about how the learning process actually works. Unit 4 will introduce some important questions about learning, such as: <em>How can we as educators ensure our students are truly achieving the outcomes we intend? What practises should educators use in order to create an effective learning environment? What role do learners play in generating and sustaining this environment? How can we maximize the likelihood of transformational learning?</em>

<tr class="odd">
<td>These are both examples of how the modern condition of thought (Unit 2), has shaped our thinking about learning. Many modern era educators viewed people as learning “machines” who could be “programmed” with instructions, just like we program computers. The legacy of this thinking still lingers and the educational model of instructors instructing students through instructions is still prevalent.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>In these modern visions, learning is something done <em>to</em> students, not something done <em>by</em> students. The learner is completely passive in the process. The dreams of grade-schoolers to be able to rest a book on their head and learn by osmosis are just as far-fetched as the prognostications from the early 20th century, from the <em>Matrix,</em> and from the claims of many edtech companies today. However, we need to recognize that learning is hard work. Consider Erasmus’s (1965) comment in his dialogue <em>The Art of Learning</em>, “For my part, I know no other art of learning than hard work, devotion, and perseverance” (p. 461). This statement remains as true today, as it was in 1529.</td>

<td>Take a few minutes to watch this video from Destin Sandlin, creator of the YouTube channel <em>Smarter Every Day</em>. The video has a long introduction, but it is entertaining and sets up the problem of learning very well:</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Destin talks about some important ideas related to pedagogy (the study of how children learn) that are also applicable to andragogy (the study of how adults learn). One of those ideas is that <em>knowledge != understanding</em> (and now you know that the ‘!’ negates the ‘=’ in that statement). A little later in this unit, when we talk about deep and surface approaches to learning, we will come back to this idea.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>!!! As a way to consolidate your own learning around this concept, take a few minutes to think about a time when you have had knowledge, but not understanding, and how that affected you in some way. You don’t have to write anything down, just connect the idea to an experience that you have had.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>In the video, Destin also talks about cognitive bias and the tremendously powerful effect that our own biases have on what and how well we learn. The challenge that he faced in learning to ride the backwards brain bike wasn’t so much the physical skills involved, but <em>unlearning</em> his previous ‘ride a bike’ algorithm. When he encountered new information that didn’t match his previous experience, it was extremely difficult to overcome his previous experience and bias. It took him 8 months of dedicated effort to do it. At the end, he discovered that he hadn’t <em>overcome</em> his bias, he had only transferred it to a new bias, albeit one that was easier to overcome.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>This process is also true for people learning new ideas. None of us come to a learning context without preconceived ideas regarding the nature of the topic to be studied, and often, those ideas are incorrect. They are misconceptions. Biases. Then, when new information comes along, our brain actively sabotages us by telling us that we already know this and we don’t need to listen, while simultaneously convincing us even more of the truth of our misconceptions.</td>

<tr class="odd">
<td>Despite the difficulty, it is important to note that we <em>can</em> overcome these biases and misconceptions. In fact, we can overcome some bizarre inputs, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/nov/12/improbable-research-seeing-upside-down">researchers have discovered and was briefly reported in The Guardian</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Here is a slightly less scientifically rigorous portrayal of what happens when our vision is artificially flipped: (The video is 12 minutes, but you don’t need to watch it all).</td>

<td><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJTC_E2Nlgg">plugin:youtube</a></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>The point of these experiments, at least for our purposes, is that human brains (and likely other animals as well) demonstrate the characteristic of <em>plasticity</em>. The connections in our brain that allow ideas to form and be adjusted can be broken and then reconnected in different configurations.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong><em>This is learning. Learning is hard work.</em></strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>One implication of this is that it is naive for educators to assume that a single exposure to an idea will somehow cause learning. In fact, the opposite is true. It takes repeated exposure, practice, error-correction, and adjustment for learning to become consolidated.</td>

</h2>
<p><strong><em>What is Coaching?</em></strong> Coaching is something that you do to help improve someone in some way. Gallway (1997) defines coaching as “a way of being, listening, asking, and speaking that draws out and augments characteristics and potential that are already present in a person.” His conceptualization of the method is analogous to Michelangelo’s approach to sculpture. Michelangelo believed that “every block of stone has a statue inside it and it’s the task of the sculptor to discover it.” Similarly, Gallway (1997) writes:</p>
<p>! <em>Coaches know that an oak tree already exists within an acorn. They have seen the one grow into the other, over time and under the right conditions, and are committed to providing those conditions to the best of their abilities. Successful coaches continually learn how best to “farm” the potential they are given to nurture.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>How do Educators Coach Learners for Learning?</em></strong> The beginning point of an effective coaching for learning practice as an educator is the coaching relationship. It’s critical, according to Gallway (1997), for coaches to “[create] a safe and challenging environment in which learning can take place.” In the educator’s role as coach, this relationship is a shared learning space where the educator enters the learners’ internal dialogue with their learning experiences. Coaching work involves two aims, <strong>(a)</strong> helping each learner become aware of their own potential and <strong>(b)</strong> helping learners remove any interference in realizing this potential. In terms of coaching for learning we know that it is a natural aspect of our nature as human beings to learn. That is, it’s something we simply do naturally. But, one thing that makes learning difficult is that our past learning gradually starts to interfere with our present and future learning.</p>
<p>Increasing learners’ awareness of their own internal resistance to new learning is the primary theme of coaching for learning. Common obstacles to learning, according to Gallway (1997), include the learner’s assumption that they already know what is being taught, the fear of being judged, doubt, and trying too hard to appear learned. In broader terms, Scharmer (2016) has identified the learners’ internal <strong><em>voice of judgement</em></strong> (VoJ), <strong><em>voice of cynicism</em></strong> (VoC), and <strong><em>voice of fear</em></strong> (VoF) as universal factors interfering with learning. The role of effective coaching is to help learners overcome these obstacles by opening their mind, emotions, and will to new possibilities. This work involves coaching learners through the transition of change—that is, <strong>(a)</strong> letting go of what was, <strong>(b)</strong> moving through the transition, and <strong>(c)</strong> embracing a new beginning.</p>
<p>The secondary theme of coaching for learning is increasing learners’ awareness of how they may best realize their potential capacity to learn anything which they set out to learn. This involves coaching learners in the learning process and helping them make it more effective and efficient. This practice builds on the notion of transforming the learners’ natural learning process into a disciplined set of study skills. A helpful approach that educators can use to coach for learning potential is the GROW coaching model. This model is based on the coaching concepts pioneered by Gallway (1997) and developed at the McKinsey consulting firm in the 1980s and first published in 1992 by John Whitmore in his book <em>Coaching for Performance</em>. The model is widely used in leadership and life coaching contexts. For educators concerned with coaching for learning, we can apply this model in the following way:</p>
<p>! <strong>[G]oal Setting.</strong> <em>Helping learners clarify <strong>what</strong> they need and more importantly want to learn? <strong>Why</strong> they need and/or truly want to learn it? And <strong>when</strong> they need to, or genuinely want, to learn it? The coach, here, also helps learners see how their personal goals can align with prescribed learning outcomes.</em></p>
<p>!! <strong>[R]eality Checking.</strong> <em>Helping learners identify what they already know? What they can already do? What they have already done? What’s moving them towards their goal? And what’s getting in the way?</em></p>
<p>!!! <strong>[O]ption Exploring.</strong> <em>Helping learners identify the various options they have to move them toward their goals. Brainstorming what else they can do to achieve their goals? Assessing what are the benefits and weaknesses of the various options that they have identified?</em></p>
<p>!!!! <strong>[W]ill be Doing.</strong> <em>Helping learners choose which options to act on. Determining when to act on an option. Assessing how committed they are to taking action a given option? Committing to acting on an option.</em></p>

</h2>
<p>Effective coaching is grounded in an emerging set of coaching competencies. These competencies represent a set of integrated knowledge, skills, aptitudes and attributes that coalesce into behaviors that define, in more detail, what is needed to successfully perform the task of helping learners learn. The following are six essential behaviors the developing educator as coach must demonstrate.</p>
<p><strong>Practicing Professional Ethics &amp; Standards</strong></p>
<p>The basis of this competency is a personal commitment to demonstrating and maintaining the highest level of ethical behavior. Emerging professional coaching standards include, <strong>(a)</strong> making the roles, responsibilities, and rights of everyone involved in the coaching relationship clear, <strong>(b)</strong> clearly communicating how information will be communicated between everyone involved in the coaching relationship, <strong>(c)</strong> maintain confidentiality of personal information and communications, <strong>(d)</strong> having a clear understanding of the conditions where information will not be kept confidential, and <strong>(e)</strong> be aware of and respond sensitively to potential power or status differences.</p>

<p><strong>Holding Space/Presence</strong></p>
<p>Being focused on the moment and giving attention to what is occurring in your conversation with the learner. Initially, this might feel like simply holding yourself back from talking too much as the coach and giving the learner space (that is, your silence) to reflect and process things. One way to conceptualize this competency as “creating a “space to listen into.” This involves <strong>(a)</strong> creating comfortable distance in physical space, <strong>(b)</strong> creating a non-judgmental emotional space, and <strong>(c)</strong> creating a quite auditory space. Holding space, or being present, is an essential way the educator as coach can demonstrate to the learner that the learner’s contribution is valued and their learning is important. It’s also important for the coach to hold space for themselves to reflect and process what is happening.</p>

<p>Facilitation in education refers to the process of helping learners to explore, learn and change. A facilitator is expert on process and group interactions. In education, facilitation is rooted in understanding the nature of the social learning process and how to guide its direction and quality. As a social species, we learn a great deal from each other in both formal and informal contexts. Our earliest learning experiences are profoundly social and intimate interactions between mother and child, and the social aspect of learning never ceases to be important. During this unit, we will examine a short history of social theories of learning from John Dewey and Lev Vygotsky, then, we will experiment with the theory and practices of facilitating learning in group settings.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">0.6</span> Topic 1: Social Theories of Learning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#topic-1-social-theories-of-learning"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The idea that learning is a social process can be traced way back in time, but formal descriptions of social constructivism, as it has been called, are often traced to John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and Lev Vygotsky. Albert Bandura also contributed via social learning theory. <em>What is social constructivism?</em></p>
<p>Vygotsky (1978) argues that “every function in the child’s cultural development appears twice: first, on the social level, and later on the individual level; first <em>between</em> people (<em>interpsychologically</em>), and then inside the child (<em>intrapsychologically</em>) (p. 57). That is, humans learn first through social observations and interactions, which they later internalize as their own thinking. The significance of Vygotsky’s insight is that, “instead of focusing on the study of psychological entities such as skills, concepts, information-processing units, reflexes, or mental functions, it assumes that we must begin with a unit of <em>activity”</em> (Wertsch, 1985). This idea of <em>activity,</em> or to be more precise the active participation of the learner, is central to our emerging understanding of learning as a process of socially constructing knowledge.</p>
<p>Central to this progress is language, which we first learn in the context of social interactions, then, we adopt as self-talk for self-direction and self-regulation, and ultimately internalized as our own inner speech (Vygotsky &amp; Kozulin, 1986, p. 228). Similarly, Bandura (1977) argues social role modeling is central to how most behaviors are learned, “from observing others one forms an idea of how new behaviors are performed, and on later occasions this coded information serves as a guide for action.”</p>
<p>In sum, we may conclude that knowledge is <em>constructed</em> first socially, then, personally, by learners as they encounter new information, compare it to old models that they may have, and develop new understandings of how the world works. It is not the case that new knowledge is simply copied intact from one mind to another, rather new information is integrated into old understandings, bringing about a hybrid of the two. This is essentially what we understand as a <em>constructivist</em> model of learning.</p>
<div id="zone-of-proximal-development-1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Zone of Proximal Development<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#zone-of-proximal-development-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Social constructivism builds on the constructivist model, adding the idea that this process of integrating new understandings with old understandings is best understood as a <em>social</em> process. Vygotsky (1978) introduced the idea that people with a greater capacity to understand the world and cope with its challenges act as supportive structures, which enable others to <em>construct</em> and <em>internalize</em> the knowledge these people have. This new construction occurs within what Vygotsky refers to as an individual’s <strong><em>zone of proximal development,</em></strong> which he differentiated from their <strong><em>zone of actual development.</em></strong> The ZPD is the ‘sweet spot’ in education where a student is optimally challenged to learn. If the task is too easy for the student, and they have already mastered it, then learning activities will not result in learning. Conversely, if a task is so difficult that the student cannot complete it, even with assistance, learning activities will not result in learning. In the middle are tasks that a student is able to complete, but only with the assistance of a more capable peer or expert. This is the Zone of Proximal Development:</p>

<div id="scaffolding-1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Scaffolding<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#scaffolding-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A metaphor that has been used to describe one such supportive mechanism is <em>scaffolding.</em> A scaffold is a way for educators to support the construction of new knowledge, beginning from a person’s existing repertoire of knowledge and then preceding into new heights of understanding. The scaffold is the environment an educator creates, the support of learning facilitation, and the processes and language that are lent to the learner in the context of approaching an adaptive task and developing new abilities to meet it (Wilhelm, Baker, &amp; Dube, 2001). Furthermore, scaffolding implies not only a person’s specific relation to the modeled behavior of others; it implies a person’s relation to social communities, and “it implies becoming a full participant, a member, a kind of person” (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1996).</p>
<p>The task of facilitating learning with the ZPD in mind assumes that you, as the facilitator, know what knowledge and skills your students are starting with. It is likely that the competencies your students display fall along a bell curve. While most students will be learning within a similar ZPD, there will be outliers at both ends of the curve. One strategy can be to pair students whose skills and knowledge are below the curve with those above the curve. In doing this, students who are above the curve, who may not be challenged with the content or skill, have to engage in greater levels of cognitive complexity in order to concisely explain to their peer and help them to meet the objective. For example, Madland and Richards (2016) describes a cooperative peer review activity, where the authors asked a group of learners how they thought cooperative learning activities supported learning. In this study, the learners’ responses indicated that the two most important factors were <em>social cohesion</em> and <em>developmentally appropriate challenges,</em> indicating that learners recognized the importance of the ZPD in learning.</p>

</h2>
<p>Cooperative learning is a set of learning facilitation strategies that are focused on encouraging educative social interactions between learners. It is important to not conflate <em>cooperative learning</em> with <em>group projects</em> as you might remember them from your previous experiences as a university student. Group projects are often assigned because faculty seem to have a sense that <em>working together</em> is a good thing for students, along with a vague sense that modern jobs all require teamwork. Too often, they amount to repurposing an individual assignment (such as, a research paper) into the same task, but with multiple people handing in one item instead of three to four. When these tasks are not well structured, the process becomes problematic.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="U5_T2_Image.jpg"></div>
<p>We have all likely experienced less-than-ideal group projects where one or two people do most of the work, one member is seemingly absent altogether, and another’s work is of poor quality. This is not the kind of learning activity that inspires highly engaged learners.</p>
<p>Contrary to this dysfunctional group learning model, cooperative learning is structured in a way that maximizes effort from all students and, ideally, leads to all group members attaining high-level learning outcomes. In order to ensure this, there are five characteristics of learning groups that must be present for cooperative learning to occur: <em>“positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interactions, appropriate use of social skills, and group processing”</em> (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009, p. 366).</p>
<details><summary><b>Positive Interdependence</b> - click here to expand
</summary><p>
Positive interdependence, according to Johnson and Johnson is the idea that individuals in a learning environment are dependent upon each other for success. In other words, I cannot succeed unless you succeed and you cannot succeed unless I succeed. So, collectively, we are interdependent. Positive interdependence is the key that distinguishes cooperative learning from competitive learning, where students are graded on a curve and only the top 2-3% of students can earn ‘A’ grades.
</p>
</details><hr>
<details><summary><b>Individual and Group Accountability</b> - click here to expand
</summary><p>
In cooperative learning environments, each individual in the group is held accountable for their contributions to the final product, and feedback is provided to both the individual and the group. This helps to ensure that students who need more assistance are identified and can be supported as needed, and it also prevents the ‘social loafing’ that is common in typical ‘group projects.’
</p>
</details><hr>
<details><summary><b>Promotive Interaction</b> - click here to expand
</summary><p>
Promotive interaction is the logistics of working and learning together as a cooperative group. The essence is that group members each need to work to promote the learning of each other member of the group. Since each person will be held accountable for their work and the entire group will only succeed if each member succeeds, there is a natural social pressure on more experienced members of the group to assist those with less experience or knowledge.
</p>
</details><hr>
<details><summary><b>Interpersonal Skills</b> - click here to expand
</summary><p>
Not only do members of the group need to learn the content of the lesson or project, but they must also learn the process of working well as a cooperative group. Sometimes, these processes need to be taught directly, other times (like in graduate studies) it is reasonable to presume that group members will already possess and be willing to utilize effective social skills.
</p>
</details><hr>
<details><summary><b>Group Processing</b> - click here to expand
</summary><p>
Finally, the group must be able to monitor their process with the goal of improving their work process and product. This metacognitive task is crucial to the long-term improvement and progress towards learning goals..

</h2>
<p>In Unit One, we examined the CoI model and identified how teaching presence helps to support both the cognitive and social presences within the educational experience of a course of study. An important idea we emphasized was that teaching presence can be a shared function between members of the learning community and that facilitation of the learning process is often shared (Garrison, et al., 2010). Now, we are interested in examining what a division of the teaching presence might look like if we professionalize the function of learning facilitation within a distributed model of teaching presence.</p>
<p>Our prototype for exploring this model is TWU’s own Facilitated Academic Resource (FAR) centre. The facilitation of courses in the TWU FAR Centre model is unique, as you know. From the perspective of a traditional, campus-based faculty member in Langley, a FAR Centre course is an <em>online</em> course. The faculty member has worked in the role subject matter expert with an instructional designer to <em>structure</em> a course which integrates everything required to create an online community of inquiry with allowances for all three presences: social, cognitive, and teaching. The courses are deployed through online technology and materials are accessed digitally in remote locations. Furthermore, students submit their work to the faculty member who then assesses their work and provides both formative and summative feedback as appropriate.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the remote student, however, the course is much more like a typical F2F course where they are meeting with a group of their fellow students in regularly scheduled learning labs in a central location and are guided through the learning materials by an experienced facilitator.</p>
<p>The rationale for this model is that international students often experience difficulties completing online courses from Western universities, so TWU is providing a F2F Academic Facilitator to support remote students in their individual and group studies through the courses. You, as the Academic Facilitation Specialist, are a critical component of this model. Your skills in coaching facilitating student learning through courses where you may not be a subject matter expert are going to be extremely important.</p>
<p>As such, you will need to start thinking about <em>how</em> to facilitate your students’ experience of a course of study’s learning activities without the immediate F2F presence of a faculty member. In the activity below, you will read about the concept and practices of facilitating transformation learning.</p>

<h3>Facilitating Group Learning Sessions<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#facilitating-group-learning-sessions-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The work of facilitating the learning process within a group setting begins with an effective plan. Smith (2009) proposes a simple model: EFFECT. This model reminds the facilitator to think about the learning <strong>environment,</strong> the <strong>focus</strong> (or purpose) of the session, <strong>feelings</strong> the session is likely to evoke, <strong>experiences</strong> learners will explore, <strong>changes</strong> learners will make as a result of the session, and the <strong>timings</strong> allocated for all the learning experiences and activities. Next, it’s important for the facilitator to plan out the structure of each learning session, which like a story, should have beginnings, middles, and endings. Each stage has a particular task. The beginning encourages learners to explore, the middle engages learners with the subject, and the ending enables learners to move on in their personal learning journey. Drawing upon Evans’ (2007) guidelines for helping conversations, Smith (2009) advises facilitators to think about “the exploration as the first quarter of the session; engaging with the subject and developing understanding as the middle half; and enabling action and development as the final quarter.”</p>

</h2>
<p>In this Unit we have examined how individual learning may be understood as a social process, however, it is also important for facilitators to understand that the group as a whole also learns and develops.</p>
<p>Forsyth (2017) defines a social group as <em>“two or more individuals who are connected to one another by and within social relationship”</em> (p. 3). The number of group members, the presence of links between members, and the nature of those links all shape the group and the quality of learning it supports.</p>
<p>An essential requirement for learning in a group is a sufficient level of cohesion and trust between members. Some of the group characteristics that tend to cultivate trust within a group include:</p>
<p><strong>Similarity</strong> - The more similar members are in terms of age, sex, education, skills, attitudes, values, and beliefs, the more likely the group will bond.</p>
<p><strong>Stability</strong> - The longer a group stays together, the more cohesive it becomes.</p>
<p><strong>Size</strong> - Smaller groups tend to have higher cohesion.</p>
<p><strong>Support</strong> - Coaching and encouragement to support other members strengthens the group’s identity.</p>
<p><strong>Satisfaction</strong> - How pleased group members are with each other’s performance, behaviour, and conformity to group norms increases cohesion.</p>
<p><em>One factor that tends to erode trust within a group is:</em></p>
<p><strong>Social Loafing</strong> - There is a tendency of individuals to put in less effort when working in a group context. As group size grows, this effect becomes larger.</p>
<div id="group-development-1" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Group Development<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#group-development-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>It is important for facilitators to understand that groups change over time. One of the most influential and helpful models of group development was articulated by Bruce W. Tuckman (1965). His research finding was that groups typically move through five critical stages of development:</p>
<p><strong>Forming:</strong> Members get to know one another, exchange personal information, and establish new relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Storming:</strong> Members open up to each other and confront each other’s ideas and perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Norming:</strong> Members achieve a consensus about goals, definition of roles, and clear coordination of effort.</p>
<p><strong>Performing:</strong> The group is able to function as a unit as they find ways to get the job done smoothly and effectively without inappropriate conflict or the need for external facilitation.</p>
<p><strong>Adjourning:</strong> At some point the group ends.</p>
<p>! <strong><em>Each stage of group development requires the facilitator to employ variations in their approach.</em></strong></p>

<p>Strategies for facilitating learning are as numerous and varied as the educators who create them. In the FAR model of professionally facilitated learning we are proposing in this course, each FAR course you may help facilitate in the future has a facilitator’s guide that provides designs for each learning activity. While these designs provide you with the majority of the learning facilitation strategies required in a given course, the needs of learners are not always predictable and emergent strategies may be needed.</p>

<code>Next Step: Unit 5: Topic 1</code>
## Topic 1: Social Theories of Learning</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>The idea that learning is a social process can be traced way back in time, but formal descriptions of social constructivism, as it has been called, are often traced to John Dewey, Jean Piaget, and Lev Vygotsky.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Modern conceptions of the learning process are based on the idea that knowledge is <em>constructed</em> by learners as they encounter new information, compare it to old models that they may have, and develop new understandings of how the world works. It is not the case that new knowledge is simply copied intact from one mind to another, rather new information is integrated into old, bringing about a hybrid of the two. This is essentially what we understand as a <em>constructivist</em> model of learning.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>#### Zone of Proximal Development{-}</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Social constructivism is the idea that this process of integrating new understandings with old understandings is best understood as a <em>social</em> process. Vygotsky’s model of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) is helpful in understanding how this is conceptualized. The ZPD is the ‘sweet spot’ in education where a student is optimally challenged to learn. If the task is too easy for the student, and they have already mastered it, then learning activities will not result in learning. Conversely, if a task is so difficult that the student cannot complete it, even with assistance, learning activities will not result in learning. In the middle are tasks that a student is able to complete, but only with the assistance of a more capable peer or expert. This is the Zone of Proximal Development.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><img src="ZPD.png"></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>##### Teaching in the ZPD{-}</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Teaching with the ZPD in mind assumes that you, as the teacher, know what knowledge and skills your students are starting with. It is likely that the competencies that your students display fall along a bell curve. While most students will be in a similar ZPD, there will be outliers at both ends of the curve. One strategy can be to pair students whose skills and knowledge are below the curve with those above the curve. In doing this, students who are above the curve, who may not be challenged with the content or skill, have to engage in greater levels of cognitive complexity in order to concisely explain to their peer and help them to meet the objective. In my M.Ed. thesis (summarized in Madland &amp; Richards, 2016) exploring a cooperative peer review activity, I asked participants how they thought cooperative learning activities supported learning. Their responses indicated that the two most important factors were <em>social cohesion</em> and <em>developmentally appropriate challenges</em>, indicating that they recognized the importance of the ZPD in learning.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>### Cooperative Learning{-}</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Cooperative learning is a set of teaching and learning strategies that are focussed on encouraging educative social interactions between learners. It is important to not conflate <em>cooperative learning</em> with <em>group projects</em> as you might remember them from your previous experiences in higher ed. Group projects are often assigned because faculty seem to have a sense that <em>working together</em> is a good thing for students, along with a vague sense that modern jobs all require teamwork. Too often, they amount to repurposing an individual assignment (maybe a research paper) into the same task, but with multiple people handing in one item instead of 3-4. When these tasks are not well structured, the process becomes problematic.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><img src="group-projects.jpg"></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>We have all likely experienced less-than-ideal group projects where one or two people do most of the work, one member is seemingly absent altogether, and another’s work is of poor quality. This is not the kind of learning activity that inspires highly engaged learners.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Contrary to that model, cooperative learning is structured in a way that maximizes effort from all students and, ideally, leads to all group members attaining high-level learning outcomes. In order to ensure this, there are 5 characteristics of learning groups that must be present for cooperative learning to occur: “positive interdependence, individual accountability, promotive interactions, appropriate use of social skills, and group processing” (Johnson &amp; Johnson, 2009, p. 366).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>##### Positive Interdependence{-}</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Positive interdependence, according to Johnson and Johnson is the idea that individuals in a learning environment are dependent upon each other for success. In other words, I cannot succeed unless you succeed and you cannot succeed unless I succeed. So, collectively, we are interdependent. Positive interdependence is the key that distinguishes cooperative learning from competitive learning, where students are graded on a curve and only the top 2-3% of students can earn ‘A’ grades.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>##### Individual and Group Accountability{-}</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>In cooperative learning environments, each individual in the group is held accountable for their contributions to the final product, and feedback is provided to both the individual and the group. This helps to ensure that students who need more assistance are identified and can be supported as needed, and it also prevents the ‘social loafing’ that is common in typical ‘group projects.’</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>##### Promotive Interaction{-}</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Promotive interaction is the logistics of working and learning together as a cooperative group. The essence is that group members each need to work to promote the learning of each other member of the group. Since each person will be held accountable for their work <em>and</em> the entire group will only succeed if each member succeeds, there is a natural social pressure on more experienced members of the group to assist those with less experience or knowledge.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>##### Interpersonal Skills{-}</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Not only do members of the group need to learn the <em>content</em> of the lesson or project, but they must also learn the <em>process</em> of working well as a cooperative group. Sometimes, these processes need to be taught directly, other times (like in graduate studies) it is reasonable to presume that group members will already possess and be willing to utilize effective social skills.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>##### Group Processing{-}</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Finally, the group must be able to monitor their process with the goal of improving their work process and product. This metacognitive task is crucial to the long-term improvement and progress towards learning goals.</td>

<td>## Topic 3: Practical Facilitation Strategies</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>The facilitation of courses in the TWU FAR Centre model is unique, as you know. From the perspective of a traditional, campus-based faculty member in Langley, a FAR Centre course is an <em>online</em> course. The faculty member has worked with an instructional designer to create a course which integrates everything required to create an online community of inquiry with allowances for all three presences: social, cognitive, and teaching presence. The courses are deployed through online technology and materials are accessed digitally in remote locations. Furthermore, students submit their work to the faculty member who then assesses their work and provides both formative and summative feedback as appropriate.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>From the perspective of the remote student, however, the course is much more like a typical F2F course where they are meeting with a group of their fellow students in a central location and are guided through the learning materials by a more experienced ‘other.’</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>The reason for this is that international students often experience difficulties completing online courses from Western universities, so TWU is providing a F2F Academic Facilitator to assist remote students through the courses. You, as the Academic Facilitation Specialist, are a critical component of this model. Your skills in coaching students through courses and activities where you may not be a subject matter expert are going to be extremely important.</td>

</h4>
<p>In this week’s conference meeting, your professor will provide a 40 minute talk
on conflict on harnessing the power of the team. The professor will include in
this talk two examples in his own life where leaders harnessed the power of the
team to accomplish great things and situations where the leader failed to
harness the power of the team and failed as a result.</p>
<p>Following the talk, the class will have an online discussion of the Teambuilding
Resources that were uploaded to the virtual campus in week 6. Following this
discussion, will be an opportunity for students to continue the discussion
online and to use the week 6 forum as a resource for their own team building as
leaders in the future.</p>
<p>This 1 hour online session will be recorded for future reference.</p>
<p><strong>Unit slides:</strong></p>
<p>In order to prepare for the meeting, you are invited to view the <a href="https://gitpitch.com/TWUOnline/gitpitch-decks/master?grs=github&amp;t=black&amp;p=LDRS502-7">Unit 7 Slides</a>. Your instructor

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Complete the conflict management process for your team you began in last week’s
unit. Upload your dispute resolution process into Moodle no later than the end
of week 7.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>See the notes below to help guide you as you design your conflict management
model.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>What is Conflict Management?</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Conflict management starts with an assumption that conflict is both normal and
healthy in all relationships. Conflict emerges when people have competing
interests, values, and roles or when people differ in their history, age,
gender, experience, ethnicity, etc. People experience conflict every day of
their lives. Conflict is more likely to occur as an internal process than a
process that occurs between people.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>In Psychology, we use terms like cognitive conflict, cognitive disequilibrium,
or cognitive dissonance to describe the internal experience people have when
their internal cognitive representations of the world come into conflict with
their immediate experiences. In fact, all models of growth and personal
development have conflict or tension at the centre of the internal pressure for
people to change, adapt and grow. A concept of Positive Emotive Tension Theory
(PETT) posits that people are strongest when they are in relationships or life
situations that exert tension or pressure on them. The tension that is created
between people is a positive force that enables balance and perspective to
impact people’s decision-making. Most people try to resolve the cognitive
dissonance that is created between internal representations of the world and
external realities of life. The concept of conflict management is that we don’t
have to always resolve conflict. We can live in a world where cognitive
representations are held in a balanced tension for long periods of time.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Conflict is Good.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Interpersonal conflict management starts with an assumption that conflict is a
good and healthy aspect of relationships. Conflict helps us share our
perspectives, to learn about others and their diverse ways of seeing the world,
to challenge our worldview and to refine our thinking to improve our
decision-making processes. The starting point to become healthy in our approach
to conflict management is to accept that conflict is good and can help us to
learn, improve, and thrive in relationships.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Conflict Management Takes Time.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Although most people would naturally desire to avoid conflict or pretend it
doesn’t exist, conflict identifies a flaw in thinking, flaw in values, flaw in
communication, or a flaw in process. In order to understand the nature of the
flaw, we need to take the time to understand all perspectives, to allow each
voice to be heard, to provide a venue for open and frank discussion, and to
communicate each person’s value to the organization.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Conflict Management Requires Consistent and Stable Structures.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Because people naturally do not trust those who disagree with them, most will
assume negative intentions, vested interests, ulterior motives, or destructive
intent when they come into conflict with others. Because these negative
reactions cloud people’s judgements about ‘the other,’ a good conflict
management process must be structurally clear and consistent. Usually, this type
of management system is defined in organizational policy in order to ensure
people know where to take matters when there is conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Conflict Management Requires Independent Processes.</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Again, As with structure, the processes involved in good conflict management
revolve around perceptions of unfairness, power inequality, gender, race and
sexual orientation inequalities (that are all protected by the human rights code
and charter), etc. As a result, there must be clear processes that are
independent of these forces. My experience is that most organizations and people
within them are not inherently biased, but when it comes to conflict, perception
becomes reality. In designing your conflict management model, you must be clear
to develop processes that cannot be influenced unduly by role or title within an
organization. It should be noted from my personal experience that Christian
organizations are often the poorest at developing good processes for conflict
management. Christian organizations start with an understanding that people love
each other, have grace, should put everyone else first, etc. These assumptions
often stem from the ‘masks’ we put on to fit in to the Christian community.
Christians are just as prone to bias, jealousy, hate, competition, feelings of
inadequacy and unfairness, etc as other people. Christian organizations are
generally in more need of good conflict management processes than other
organizations are.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>What does a good conflict management system look like?</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1. There is an underlying assumption that people do not mean to do harm or
damage and that they are trying to do what they believe it right.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>2. People’s feelings are always real. Whether we agree with how those feelings
arose or whether they are justified and proportionate, the experience of the
other is a real experience.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3. People need help to manage conflict. People don’t know how to manage
conflict effectively and are usually prone to ignore the conflict rather
than manage it effectively.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4. People don’t know how to communicate well regarding conflict. People may not
be able to contain their emotions and hold in their thoughts when it comes
to conflict. Often the emotion has been pent up for so long that when it is
time to speak, words are not organized well and thinking is not clear.
anger, rage, hostility, fear, crying all may emerge when discussing
conflicts. The person who is managing the conflict process must not take
things personally as they may initially bear the brunt of the pent up
emotional response.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>5. Conflict management must have an internal and an external process to ensure
that the issues can be addressed fairly and completely.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>MODEL</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Internal</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>1. Initial conflict is brought to the attention of the other person. After a
frank discussion and presentation of issues and sides, the conflict is
either addressed or needs to be escalated.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>2. Immediate supervisor is brought in to hear both sides and attempt to mediate
the conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>3. An internal conflict resolution system is engaged to manage the process. Two
sides are usually formalized at this point with written presentations from
both sides. A internal neutral third party (often HR) is brought in to hear
the sides and make a recommendation.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>External</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>4. If internal processes cannot resolve the conflict, an outside mediator with
training in such matters is brought into the issue.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>5. If the mediator is unable to manage the conflict effectively, arbitration or
binding arbitration is the final step. Usually arbitration brings closure, but
often underlying feelings remain.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>6. Depending on the organization, there is always the right to sue and take
legal action independently against the institution</td>
