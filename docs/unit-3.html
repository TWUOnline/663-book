<h2>Unit 3: Teaching and Learning with Technology<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#unit-3-teaching-and-learning-with-technology"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>There are some critical digital literacies that you will need to begin or continue to develop during this course. These skills and competencies that you will be developing are not intended to to be merely for the sake of learning so-called ‚Äò21st-century skills‚Äô that are much ballyhooed in education circles. Rather, the unique structure of TWU microcampuses and the FAR Centre learning model require robust technological infrastructure to support our processes from initiating a course design project through the design, development, and production of learning materials and environments, to the ongoing maintenance and evergreening of courses deployed in widely diverse locations across the world. You will be required to interact with this infrastructure in order to access course materials; communicate with the faculty member responsible for the courses you are facilitating, as well as with administrative departments at TWU; participate in the process of localizing learning activities; and supporting the work of your fellow Academic Facilitation Specialists in other locations.</p>

<p>For the next two weeks, we will be exploring some technology tools that can help make the management of remote learning environments easier. As you know, there are two general cohorts of learners in this course, FAR Facilitators and generalists. Those of you on track to work as FAR Centre Facilitators will be asked to engage with the GitHub/Grav workflow, but if you are here from an outside organization, you may choose between the GitHub/Grav workflow and learning WordPress. Admittedly, WordPress has a much shallower learning curve, and it also will have much broader immediate applicability to other contexts.</p>
<p>We will be helping you set up an individual website in either Grav or WordPress that you can use as you continue with your studies.</p>

<p>Digital literacy has almost nothing to do with age and the idea of ‚Äòdigital natives‚Äô (younger people being able to use technology more easily because they grew up with it) is the wrong way to think about digital literacy.</p>
<p>It is likely that you have encountered and may believe that there is a distinction between digital ‚Äònatives‚Äô and ‚Äòimmigrants.‚Äô</p>
<p>[details=‚ÄúNote‚Äù]
<a href="https://marcprensky.com/">Marc Prensky</a>, who proposed this idea, is the one who thought it would be a good idea to refer to people as ‚Äònatives.‚Äô We recognize that this term should not be used to talk about people.
[/details]</p>
<p>The essential argument is that <em>kids these days</em> have changed in that they have this innate ability to use and learn technology because they have grown up using technology, and those of us whose formative years pre-date the advent of the internet are forever at a disadvantage compared to the <em>kids</em>. You can read a bit more about the idea on Wikipedia, linked below. There is also a link in that article to Prensky‚Äôs original article.</p>
<a class="embedly-card" data-card-controls="0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_native">Digital native</a>
<script async src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Aside from the problematic framing of learners as kids, there are some distinct challenges with the idea of digital literacy being a fixed trait rather than a matter of comfort, familiarity, and a skill that can be practiced and learned. It is no secret that more young people are comfortable using social media apps like TikTok, Instagram, SnapChat, Weibo, WeChat, and the like, but that does not mean that those people are more able to learn technology than older people or that they have an innate ability to do so. Have you ever asked a 1st-year university student to use a spreadsheet to create a budget or a gradebook with embedded formulae? It is more likely than not, that you will encounter a distinct lack of skill in completing this task.</p>

<div id="residents-and-visitors" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Residents and Visitors<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#residents-and-visitors"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>I‚Äôd like to introduce you to a different way to conceptualize your relationship with digital media, and that is that you may be a <em>visitor</em> in some web spaces and a <em>resident</em> in others. Places on the web where you might be a visitor are those places where you, quite literally, visit, but importantly, don‚Äôt leave a public trace of your time there. You don‚Äôt spend any time interacting with people, but rather, you take a rather utilitarian approach by visiting a site, doing a thing, and leaving.</p>
<p>Alternately, there are places and spaces on the web, where <em>you</em> reside as a persona, where you interact, socialize, and leave traces of yourself online. For some, that may be Facebook, where you keep in touch with friends and family, or Twitter, or maybe it‚Äôs a listserv you subscribed to back in the 90s, or your blog, or someone else‚Äôs blog or social site. The important distinction is that these are places where you connect with other people; where you are socially <em>present</em>.</p>
<p>At the same time, if we can imagine the visitor &lt;‚Äì&gt; resident continuum on a horizontal axis, there is also a personal &lt;‚Äì&gt; professional (or educational) continuum on a vertical axis, leading to 4 quadrants where you might situate your technology use.</p>
<p>The video below explains a process to help you think about where you reside on the web (7 mins).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPOG3iThmRI">plugin:youtube</a></p>
<p>I‚Äôve shared my VR Diagram below‚Ä¶keep in mind that this diagram represents a set of tools that I have been using for a decade or more and that I have invested my career in educational technology. There is a lot here, but yours might look significantly different with only a few tools here and there. The main thing I would like to communicate with this idea of visitors and residents is for you to think about which technologies you use as a resident, and then to think about where your learners reside on the web. From there, we can begin to plan for tools we can use that afford us and our learners the opportunity to reside there.</p>

<p>It is certainly notable that I am very much a visitor in Moodle! This does not mean that I don‚Äôt spend much time there, I spend a significant portion of every day working in Moodle, rather, the work that I do there leaves very little trace of my personality. You will (hopefully) see Moodle as much more of a place where you reside. But this foregrounds the question of whether Moodle is actually designed to promote residencies. Certainly the forums allow for users to project their persona into the system, as do a few of the other features, but the system itself is very heavily templated. There are profiles that can be edited, but users are limited to one very tiny image and virtually no opportunity to determine for themselves what they want to share. There is little room for customization, and every time a course ends, every single user must recreate their persona in a new course site (or five).</p>
<p>For many, or most, of you, Moodle is a perfectly reasonable place to reside and you are able to make learners feel at home there. We encourage that. And just like our physical homes, the quality of the community that lives there isn‚Äôt determined by the features of the house itself, but by the people who share the space and how they structure their time and interactions.</p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt already, I encourage you to subscribe to this excellent podcast called <em>Teaching in Higher Ed</em> by <a href="https://twitter.com/bonni208">Bonni Stachowiak</a>, or, just take 47 minutes to listen to this episode in which Bonni interviews Dave White about the idea of visitors and residents.</p>

<p>It is second nature to most to take selfies and share them on Instagram, Snapchat, etc., but once you move into the role of an educator in either a public or private context, you must adhere to the laws set out by the <a href="https://www.oipc.bc.ca/">B.C. Office of Information and Privacy Commissioner</a>. Their office has put together guidelines for both public bodies and private bodies. TWU, as a private body is not held to the same standard as public bodies, but we should strive to meet the same standard. The guidelines for public bodies to better understand what the rules are is linked below and how to get consent is detailed on page 4 of the <a href="https://esquimalt.public.sd61.bc.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/34/2013/09/OIPC-Cloud-Computing-Guidelines-for-Public-Bodies.pdf">BC Cloud Computing Guidelines (PDF)</a> and you can review the <a href="http://www.bclaws.ca/Recon/document/ID/freeside/96165_00">Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act here.</a>. <a href="https://www.twu.ca/about/university-privacy-policy">TWU also has a privacy policy, available here.</a></p>
<p>Each public body will have their own process (which may range from not allowing tools to pressure to integrate networked learning tools from outside of Canada), so it is important to understand your own setting and the law. You may find some administrators or staff breaking these rules or not aware of them. It is important for you to enter your field and uphold the law, regardless of the culture you enter. This does not mean that you do not engage online or outside of Canada. It means that if/when you do so, that you understand the steps, which are not much more complex than the consent you would get normally for going ‚Äúon the Internet,‚Äù as is described in most settings, but you must name the date consent is effective and, if applicable, the date it expires. It is important that you work with your school district on the consent process. You can see an example of how K-12 school districts are addressing access to cloud tools outside of Canada <a href="http://www.sd43.bc.ca/Resources/DigitalCitizenship/Pages/CloudTools.aspx">here (Coquitlam)</a> and <a href="https://www.sd61.bc.ca/programs/digital-learning/sd61-gafe/privacy-and-personal-information/">here</a> plus <a href="https://techforlearning.sd61.bc.ca/privacy/consent-process/">here (Victoria)</a>. You must also name each tool individually. It cannot be ‚Äúblogging.‚Äù You must name WordPress.com or Blogger, etc. If you use Flipgrid, you must name Flipgrid. Consent must also be informed, so effort must be taken to ensure that those signing consent understand the implications ‚Äì that their data may leave Canada, how it may be harvested, and to know about the U.S. Patriot Act. One archived resource by the Canadian Treasury Board provides significant detailed information about the <a href="https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/pubs_pol/gospubs/TBM_128/usapa/faq-eng.asp">Patriot Act here</a>. It is helpful to also review <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/education/kindergarten-to-grade-12/teach/teaching-tools/digital-literacy-framework.pdf">section 4(b) of the B.C. Digital Literacy Framework which is applicable K12 contexts</a> but helpful for others.</p>

<p>Learners should ensure that they:
- Are aware of the OIPC, FIPPA, and the Cloud Computing Guidelines and follow them
- Understand what constitutes personal information
- Understand that privacy online is a personal choice and must be respected
- Understand if that you assume an ‚Äúeducator‚Äù hat, you have a duty for those under your care, their parents and families, and your colleagues with regard to their privacy and protection of personal information
- Are aware that the Canadian federal government states that the chances are remote that the US Patriot Act will access personal information of Canadians, but recognizes that it is our responsibility to protect privacy preferences and to ensure that consent obtained is informed consent. Some families may be involved with restraining orders and need to be private for their safety, but the reasons for privacy may be preference.

<p>We‚Äôre going to take a little break from the so-called ‚Äòacademic content‚Äô of this course and dive into some technical skills and digital literacies that you will need to succeed in a TWU microcampus. Keep in mind that the skills needed to use this workflow can be learned. It might take some more work for some of you than others, but you will all get there. Be patient. Ask for help from your colleagues and instructors. Be persistent. You‚Äôve got this.</p>

<h3>GitHub<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#github-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Throughout this course, we will be using a web application called GitHub to manage a large portion of your coursework. We also rely heavily on GitHub and the workflow that you will learn during this course to manage course materials that are ultimately displayed in Moodle or WordPress for students. GitHub is a web tool that allows distributed teams to cooperatively contribute to documents and to track projects. You might be familiar with Google Docs, which is a collaborative tool for creating and editing documents. GitHub shares some similarities with Google Docs, but there are also some important differences.</p>
<p>These differences will become apparent as you become familiar with GitHub, but for now, just keep in mind that GitHub doesn‚Äôt have the same ‚Äòreal-time collaboration‚Äô that you see in Google Docs, where multiple people can edit the same document at the same time and everyone can see everyone else‚Äôs changes in real-time.</p>
<p>If this all sounds overwhelming, don‚Äôt worry, we will walk you through each of the skills that you will need to navigate in GitHub.</p>

<div id="why-github" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Why GitHub?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-github"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Good question! GitHub will admittedly require you to learn some new ways of thinking about and interacting with software. The lingo in GitHub and the interface might seem obtuse and unnecessarily ‚Äòjargony,‚Äô but as you become more familiar with the capabilities and affordances of the tool, it will become second nature.</p>
<p>We are not using GitHub in order to make your life difficult! We are using GitHub because the structure of our organization requires robust technological infrastructure to manage our work, which is fundamentally decentralized with multiple interested users in different part of the world. For any given course, we will engage with the following groups and users:</p>
<ul>
<li>instructional designers</li>
<li>subject matter experts</li>
<li>editors</li>
<li>production staff</li>
<li>media producers</li>
<li>librarians</li>
<li>marketing and communications</li>
<li>department administrators (Deans, Chairs)</li>
<li>GLOBAL support staff</li>
<li>university administrators (committees, Provost)</li>
<li>teaching faculty (usually, but not always, the SME)</li>
<li>Academic Facilitation Specialists</li>
<li>Micro-campus administrators</li>
<li>partner institution administrators, and of course,</li>
<li>learners</li>
</ul>
<p>This wide variety of stakeholders means that we need to be very intentional about how we manage our workflows.</p>

<div id="using-github" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Using GitHub<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-github"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>GitHub and similar tools allow distributed teams to collaborate and track changes and versions of large, text-based repositories. Git, the software that is at the foundation of GitHub was created to manage the process of creating the Linux operating system, and it is now the industry standard for large software development projects.</p>
<p>One reason that Git is so good for large, distributed projects is that it preserves a record of every change that happens to a particular file and who made that change. It also keeps track of whose change happened when so that users can sort out any conflicts. It is admittedly a different workflow from what most people are used to, which is likely composing .xml files in MS Word (did you know you are composing XML files in MS Word?).</p>
<p>However, you are here to learn how to use Github, so let‚Äôs get on with that.</p>
<p>First, there is some lingo that you need to become familiar with.</p>
<ul>
<li>repository (repo): a collection of files and folders, similar to how project folders are organized on your desktop</li>
<li>clone: downloading all the files in a repo from GitHub (on the web) to your local computer</li>
<li>commit: saving some changes to a repo</li>
<li>push: sending changes to a repo from your desktop (local) to GitHub (remote)</li>
<li>fetch: checking to see if your local copy of a repo needs to be updated with new commits from the remote</li>
<li>pull: updating your local copy with changes from GitHub</li>
<li>fork: creating an exact copy of someone else‚Äôs repo in your own account</li>
<li>pull request: sending a request to the owner of a repo to merge your suggested changes with their repo.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is ok if these don‚Äôt make much sense right now, but they are a necessary part of a git-based workflow and they help to maintain structure and order in a project.</p>

<p>!! You will need to rename the folder as well as the ‚Äòdocs.md‚Äô file within the folder.</p>
<p>Now that you have installed the software that you will need and you have cloned the <code>far-community</code> repo to your computer and opened it in Atom, you should see the folder in your <code>Project</code> list on the left panel of Atom. Tap the title to open the folder, then tap <code>pages</code> to see a list of all of your colleagues‚Äô sites, as below. As of this first writing, you will only see Colin‚Äôs site as <code>03.colin-madland</code> and the master site as <code>99.MASTER</code>.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="site-setup-1.png"></div>
<p>Each numbered folder in the <code>pages</code> folder represents a single site in the community. You will be able to customize your site with your own header image and pages as you see fit.</p>
<p>The structure of the Community Hub is identical to the structure of each course hub. The significant difference is that we have several course hubs with each academic discipline area having its own hub, such as <code>ldrs-master</code> and <code>arts-master</code>.</p>
<div id="duplicate-99.master-1" class="section level5" number="0.2.2.4.1">
<h5>
<span class="header-section-number">0.2.2.4.1</span> Duplicate <code>99.MASTER</code><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#duplicate-99.master-1"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<p>To get started on your own site, right-click on <code>99.MASTER</code> and choose ‚ÄòDuplicate‚Äô from the dropdown menu.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="site-setup-2.png"></div>
</div>
<div id="edit-the-title." class="section level5" number="0.2.2.4.2">

<span class="header-section-number">0.2.2.4.2</span> Edit the title.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#edit-the-title."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<p>Change the number <code>99</code> to the number that corresponds with where your last name is in alphabetical order in the list of sites. You can duplicate a previous number, so if your name falls between <code>04.colin-madland</code> and <code>05.chisako-takano</code>, you can use <code>04.your-name</code> or <code>05.your-name</code>. You will learn how to re-number sites in a later step. Then, after the <code>.</code> add your <code>firstname-lastname</code> all in lower-case and with no spaces and hit ‚ÄòReturn/Enter.‚Äô</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="site-setup-3.png"></div>
<p>You will see your new folder in the list of folders, and it will be green.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="site-setup-4.png"></div>

<div id="edit-site-details." class="section level5" number="0.2.2.4.3">

<span class="header-section-number">0.2.2.4.3</span> Edit site details.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#edit-site-details."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<p>Click on your folder in the list to see its contents. The numbered folders are all pages on your site. Down at the bottom, there should be a <code>course.md</code> file, click that to open it in the editing pane of Atom.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="site-setup-5.png"></div>
<p>You will need to change two things in the <code>YAML</code> at the top of the page.</p>
<p>The <code>title</code> should be changed to your name and <code>course_list_description</code> can be a short phrase you want to use as a sub-title for your site.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="site-setup-6.png"></div>
<p>Then you need to change the link to the content-inject page to match the title you chose for your site when you duplicated the master.</p>
<p><code>[plugin:content-inject](/master/blog/_important-reminders)</code> needs to be changed to <code>[plugin:content-inject](/firstname-lastname/blog/_important-reminders)</code>, exactly as it is in the list of folders.</p>
<p>When you are done this step, you should see this on the <code>course.md</code> file.</p>

<div id="publish-your-site." class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Publish your site.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#publish-your-site."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>

<p>Now that you have started the basics of personalizing your site, it‚Äôs time to publish it to the Community.</p>
<p>Click the <code>Git</code> panel in the bottom, right corner of Atom.</p>
<p>At the top of the panel, you will see a list of <code>Unstaged Changes</code> indicated for now as files with a green ‚Äò+‚Äô beside them because they are new files. At this point, you have saved the changes to the files on your computer only. If you tap on one of the files, you will be able to see what changes you are proposing.</p>
<p>Tap <code>Stage All</code> in the top, right and the files will move to the <code>Staged Changes</code> panel. This means that you are ready to send them to GitHub.</p>

<p>If you are not in the FAR Facilitation track, please follow these instructions to set up a WordPress site.</p>
<div id="wordpress-privacy" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>WordPress Privacy<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#wordpress-privacy"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Now that you have thought about privacy in our digital world, it is time for you to make some decisions about how you would like to ‚Äòbe‚Äô online.</p>
<p>You are invited to document your learning in WordPress. This means that your work would be posted online on a public site. Keep in mind, though, that you are NOT required to post your work publicly. The steps below can help you decide how comfortable you are with sharing publicly.</p>
<p>Please review all 5 steps below to decide on your approach.
##### Decide if you are comfortable posting your work online.{-}</p>
<p>If not, you can document your learning offline (with technology) by changing the privacy settings on your blog or using Word documents and offline video. We would ask learners to consider using an online blogging tool with no identification/using a pseudonym, so as to develop network literacy, which is important in supporting learners, who are growing up in networked environments, but the preferences of learners will be respected and supported.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable being online, then proceed to step 2.</p>
<div id="would-you-like-to-use-your-real-name-or-use-a-pseudonym" class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Would you like to use your real name or use a pseudonym?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#would-you-like-to-use-your-real-name-or-use-a-pseudonym"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<p>You can claim your name online and own your presence by using your full name. With increasing catfishing and identity theft online, it can be helpful to have a presence that may compete with any fake profiles of you that are out there or to have a more dominant presence so posts or pictures of you by others may get drowned out. That said, you may wish to create an identity without your personal information (e.g., West coast teacher). The choice is yours.</p>
<p>With that decision made, proceed to step 3.</p>
</div>
<div id="decide-if-you-would-like-your-blog-to-be-hosted-outside-of-canada-or-inside-of-canada." class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Decide if you would like your blog to be hosted outside of Canada or inside of Canada.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#decide-if-you-would-like-your-blog-to-be-hosted-outside-of-canada-or-inside-of-canada."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<p>We strongly recommend that you create a blog at create.twu.ca which is built specifically for students and faculty at TWU, is hosted within Canada, and is completely free for you to use. We also have created a template for you there, which will make getting started easier. You will not lose access to your site at create.twu.ca after you finish at TWU, but you are free to export it and publish it on your own space and on your own domain (e.g., <a href="http://yourname.ca" class="uri">http://yourname.ca</a> or <a href="http://westcoastteacher.ca" class="uri">http://westcoastteacher.ca</a>) with a web hosting company for a reasonable annual fee. Some of these companies host outside of Canada (e.g., Dreamhost), while others host within Canada (e.g., Canadian Web Hosting).</p>
<p>Be sure you review the resources under the privacy tutorial on this site or talk to your instructor about the implications of your options. You should also review the resources at the BC Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner along with the Cloud Computing Guidelines, which outline how to get consent.</p>
<p>With that decision made, proceed to step 4.</p>
</div>
<div id="you-also-have-to-decide-if-you-want-to-make-your-blog-public-or-private." class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>You also have to decide if you want to make your blog public or private.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#you-also-have-to-decide-if-you-want-to-make-your-blog-public-or-private."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<p>You can set an entire blog to be private or simply selected posts can be set to private. You can set a password or invite people to gain access. We have provided instructions for adjusting your privacy settings on the tutorial page for opened.ca.</p>
<p>!! Important!
!! If you choose to make your blog private, we will not be able to syndicate your posts to the course site. You will still be able to participate in the course, but please contact your instructor if you choose to make your site only visible to registered users of the network or your site.</p>
<p>And last, but not least‚Ä¶</p>
</div>
<div id="finally-you-have-to-think-about-where-you-and-your-content-will-end-up." class="section level5 unnumbered">
<h5>Finally, you have to think about where you and your content will end up.<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#finally-you-have-to-think-about-where-you-and-your-content-will-end-up."><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h5>
<p>The wonderful thing about WordPress is that you can import that exported file into another WordPress instance (it sounds hard, but it isn‚Äôt and we‚Äôll show you) or if you want to later set up your own domain and with your own WordPress installation. You may also import it into WordPress.com, but be aware that if you made posts with personal information knowing your site was hosted in Canada at the time and simply contained regular consent, without the specific consent for hosting outside of Canada, which requires you to name each tool, etc., you might not have consent to switch to WordPress.com. We often advise learners to post as if they will be on the cloud outside of Canada. To be honest, if you have a public blog, your friends and colleagues may be using U.S. cloud-hosted tools like Feedly to curate and read your blog posts or they may repost/quote your content on their U.S. blog. There are many educators who use U.S. software in their teaching and to support their learners. Just be sure to review how to get consent as per page four of the BC OIPC Cloud Computing Guidelines linked here.</p>
